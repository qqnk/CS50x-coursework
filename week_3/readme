Project: plurality.c runs a plurality election, where users can vote for one candidate, and the election leader is printed (maximum of 9 candidates). Portions of the code provided, //TODO #1 -2 are original code.

Project: runoff.c runs a runoff election, where users can vote for their top 3 candidates, and the candidate with more than 50% of votes is declared the winner. If no candidate has a majority vote, the candidate who received the fewest number of votes is eliminated, and anyone who originally chose that candidate as their first preference now has their second preference considered. This cycle is repeated until a candidate has a majority of the votes. A tie between candidates can also be decalred. ortion of the code was provided, and //TODO #1 - 6 are original code.
